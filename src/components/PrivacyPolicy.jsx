        How We Use Your Information
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        The information we collect is used strictly to improve your experience with our
        agency. We use your contact details to respond to inquiries, follow up on project
        discussions, share proposals or invoices, and deliver services effectively.
        Internally, we may analyze anonymized user behavior to enhance our website’s

        you explicitly opt in, and we never sell or trade your personal information to
        outside parties. Our focus is on providing value through transparent and most
        respectful communication.
